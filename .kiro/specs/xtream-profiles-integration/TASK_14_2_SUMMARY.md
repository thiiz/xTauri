# Task 14.2: Add Advanced Filtering Options - Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive advanced filtering capabilities for all Xtream content types with support for filter presets and saved searches.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Filter Module (`src-tauri/src/xtream/filter.rs`)
Enhanced filtering with multiple criteria:

#### Channel Filtering
- **ChannelFilter** structure with:
  - Name filter (partial match)
  - Category ID filter
  - Group filter
- Case-insensitive name matching
- Multiple filter criteria combination

#### Movie Filtering
- **MovieFilter** structure with:
  - Name filter (partial match)
  - Category ID filter
  - Genre filter (partial match)
  - Year filter (exact match)
  - Minimum rating filter
- Support for all metadata-based filtering
- Rating-based filtering with 5-star scale

#### Series Filtering
- **SeriesFilter** structure with:
  - Name filter (partial match)
  - Category ID filter
  - Genre filter (partial match)
  - Year filter (release date matching)
  - Minimum rating filter
- Genre and year filtering from metadata
- Rating-based filtering

### 2. Saved Filters Module (`src-tauri/src/xtream/saved_filters.rs`)
Complete filter preset management:

- **SavedFilter** structure:
  - Profile-specific filters
  - Named filter presets
  - Content type association
  - JSON-serialized filter data
  - Creation and last used timestamps
  
- **Database Operations**:
  - `create_filter()`: Create new filter preset
  - `get_filters()`: Get all filters (optionally by content type)
  - `get_filter()`: Get specific filter by ID
  - `update_filter()`: Update filter name or data
  - `update_last_used()`: Track filter usage
  - `delete_filter()`: Remove filter preset
  - `clear_filters()`: Clear all filters for profile

- **Features**:
  - Profile isolation (filters per profile)
  - Content type categorization
  - Unique constraint on (profile, name, content_type)
  - Automatic sorting by last used, then creation date
  - Full CRUD operations

### 3. Tauri Commands (`src-tauri/src/xtream/commands.rs`)
Added commands for advanced filtering:

#### Filter Commands
- `filter_channels_advanced`: Apply advanced channel filters
- `filter_movies_advanced`: Apply advanced movie filters
- `filter_series_advanced`: Apply advanced series filters

#### Saved Filter Commands
- `create_xtream_saved_filter`: Create new filter preset
- `get_xtream_saved_filters`: Get all saved filters
- `get_xtream_saved_filter`: Get specific filter
- `update_xtream_saved_filter`: Update filter
- `update_xtream_saved_filter_last_used`: Track usage
- `delete_xtream_saved_filter`: Delete filter
- `clear_xtream_saved_filters`: Clear all filters

### 4. Database Schema
Added `xtream_saved_filters` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE xtream_saved_filters (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    profile_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    content_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    filter_data TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_used DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (profile_id) REFERENCES xtream_profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE(profile_id, name, content_type)
)
```
With index on `(profile_id, content_type)` for performance.

## Features Implemented

### Advanced Filtering
- ✅ Category-based filtering for all content types
- ✅ Genre filtering for movies and series
- ✅ Rating filtering (minimum rating threshold)
- ✅ Year filtering for movies and series
- ✅ Name/title filtering with partial matching
- ✅ Multiple criteria combination (AND logic)
- ✅ Case-insensitive text matching

### Filter Presets
- ✅ Save filter configurations with custom names
- ✅ Profile-specific filter storage
- ✅ Content type categorization
- ✅ Quick filter application
- ✅ Filter usage tracking (last used timestamp)
- ✅ Filter management (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Automatic sorting by usage frequency

### Saved Searches
- ✅ Persist filter configurations as JSON
- ✅ Reusable filter presets
- ✅ Named filter collections
- ✅ Easy filter recall and application

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ Requirement 9.2: Category-based filtering for all content types
- ✅ Requirement 9.3: Genre, rating, and metadata filtering
- ✅ Requirement 9.5: Filter presets and saved searches
- ✅ Profile-specific filter isolation
- ✅ Filter usage analytics

## Testing
- Unit tests for all filter functions
- Unit tests for saved filters database operations
- Test coverage for:
  - Single criterion filtering
  - Multiple criteria combination
  - Edge cases (empty filters, no matches)
  - Filter preset CRUD operations
  - Profile isolation
  - Unique constraint enforcement

## Filter Capabilities by Content Type

### Channels
- Name (partial match)
- Category
- Group

### Movies
- Name (partial match)
- Category
- Genre (partial match)
- Year (exact match)
- Minimum rating (5-star scale)

### Series
- Name (partial match)
- Category
- Genre (partial match)
- Year (release date)
- Minimum rating (5-star scale)

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient in-memory filtering
- Database indexing for saved filters
- Lazy loading support
- Minimal overhead for filter application

## Integration Points
- Works with existing content fetching commands
- Compatible with search functionality
- Supports pagination
- Profile-aware filtering

## Next Steps
Frontend implementation will include:
- Filter UI components
- Saved filter management interface
- Quick filter application
