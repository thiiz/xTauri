# Task 11.2: Viewing History Tracking - Verification Checklist

## Implementation Verification

### ✅ Sub-task 1: Add automatic history tracking for played content

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Evidence:**
1. Created `useHistoryTracking` hook in `src/hooks/useHistoryTracking.ts`
   - Automatically adds content to history when playback starts
   - Updates playback position at configurable intervals
   - Handles cleanup and state management
   - Debounces updates to prevent excessive API calls

2. Store integration in `src/stores/xtreamContentStore.ts`
   - `addToHistory()` action for adding content
   - `updatePlaybackPosition()` action for position updates
   - Proper error handling and state management

**Verification Steps:**
- [x] Hook created with automatic tracking logic
- [x] Integration with Tauri backend commands
- [x] Debouncing implemented (500ms delay)
- [x] Configurable update interval (default 10 seconds)
- [x] Cleanup on component unmount
- [x] State reset on content change

### ✅ Sub-task 2: Implement history storage per profile with metadata

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Evidence:**
1. Type definitions added to `src/types/types.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export type XtreamHistory = {
     id: string;
     profile_id: string;
     content_type: string;
     content_id: string;
     content_data: any;
     watched_at: string;
     position?: number;
     duration?: number;
   };
   ```

2. Store actions for history management:
   - `fetchHistory(profileId, limit?)` - Retrieve history
   - `fetchHistoryByType(profileId, contentType, limit?)` - Filtered retrieval
   - `getHistoryItem(profileId, contentType, contentId)` - Get specific item
   - `removeFromHistory(historyId)` - Remove item
   - `clearHistory(profileId)` - Clear all history

3. Backend integration:
   - Uses existing `add_xtream_history` command
   - Uses existing `update_xtream_history_position` command
   - Uses existing `get_xtream_history` command
   - All commands properly integrated with database

**Verification Steps:**
- [x] History types defined with all required fields
- [x] Profile-specific storage (profile_id field)
- [x] Full content metadata preserved (content_data field)
- [x] Playback position tracking (position field)
- [x] Duration tracking (duration field)
- [x] Timestamp tracking (watched_at field)
- [x] Content type tracking (content_type field)
- [x] Store actions implemented
- [x] Backend commands integrated

---

### ✅ Requirement 10.5: History is stored per profile with metadata

**Implementation:**

## Additional Features Implemented

### Resume Position Hook
Created `useResumePosition` hook for retrieving resume positions:
- Gets last watched position from history
- Only suggests resume if watched between 5% and 95%
- Returns position, duration, and progress percentage
- Returns null if no valid resume point exists

**Verification:**
- [x] Hook created
- [x] Resume logic implemented
- [x] Progress calculation
- [x] Boundary conditions (5% - 95%)

  enabled: isPlaying
});

// In video player's time update handler
