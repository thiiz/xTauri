# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Xtream Codes API functionality into the existing IPTV application, replacing the current playlist-based approach with a profile-based system. Each profile will contain the necessary credentials and configuration to connect to an Xtream Codes server, allowing users to manage multiple IPTV providers simultaneously. The integration will provide access to live channels, VOD content, TV series, and EPG data through the standardized Xtream Codes API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an IPTV user, I want to create and manage multiple Xtream Codes profiles, so that I can access content from different IPTV providers within a single application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to profile management THEN the system SHALL display a list of existing profiles with options to add, edit, or delete profiles
2. WHEN a user creates a new profile THEN the system SHALL require name, username, password, and URL fields to be filled
3. WHEN a user saves a profile THEN the system SHALL validate the credentials by attempting to authenticate with the Xtream server
4. WHEN profile validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL store the profile securely and display a success message
5. WHEN profile validation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and prevent saving
6. WHEN a user deletes a profile THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data and confirm the deletion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an IPTV user, I want to switch between different Xtream profiles, so that I can access content from different providers without re-entering credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a profile THEN the system SHALL authenticate with the corresponding Xtream server
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL load and display the available content categories
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and remain on the current profile
4. WHEN switching profiles THEN the system SHALL clear previous content data and show loading indicators
5. WHEN no profile is selected THEN the system SHALL display a prompt to create or select a profile

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an IPTV user, I want to browse live channels from my Xtream provider, so that I can watch live television content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a profile is active THEN the system SHALL fetch and display live channel categories
2. WHEN a user selects a category THEN the system SHALL load and display channels within that category
3. WHEN displaying channels THEN the system SHALL show channel name, logo, EPG information, and group
4. WHEN a user selects a channel THEN the system SHALL generate the appropriate streaming URL and begin playback
5. WHEN channel data is loading THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
6. WHEN channel loading fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an IPTV user, I want to access VOD (Video on Demand) content from my Xtream provider, so that I can watch movies and other on-demand content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a profile is active THEN the system SHALL fetch and display movie categories
2. WHEN a user selects a movie category THEN the system SHALL load and display available movies
3. WHEN displaying movies THEN the system SHALL show title, poster, rating, genre, and description
4. WHEN a user selects a movie THEN the system SHALL fetch detailed information and generate streaming URL
5. WHEN movie playback starts THEN the system SHALL support standard video controls (play, pause, seek, volume)
6. WHEN movie data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an IPTV user, I want to access TV series from my Xtream provider, so that I can watch episodic content organized by seasons.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a profile is active THEN the system SHALL fetch and display TV series categories
2. WHEN a user selects a series category THEN the system SHALL load and display available series
3. WHEN a user selects a series THEN the system SHALL display seasons and episodes with metadata
4. WHEN displaying episodes THEN the system SHALL show episode title, description, duration, and air date
5. WHEN a user selects an episode THEN the system SHALL generate streaming URL and begin playback
6. WHEN series data is loading THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate loading feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an IPTV user, I want to view Electronic Program Guide (EPG) information, so that I can see current and upcoming programming for live channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a live channel THEN the system SHALL display current program information if available

3. WHEN a user requests detailed EPG THEN the system SHALL fetch and display extended program guide
4. WHEN EPG data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL indicate no program information is available
5. WHEN EPG data is loading THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want profile credentials to be stored securely, so that user authentication information is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN accessing stored credentials THEN the system SHALL decrypt data only when needed for API calls
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL NOT display credentials in plain text in any UI
4. WHEN debugging or logging THEN the system SHALL NOT include credentials in log files
5. WHEN exporting or backing up data THEN the system SHALL maintain encryption of sensitive information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an IPTV user, I want the application to handle network errors gracefully, so that temporary connectivity issues don't crash the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL attempt to re-authenticate automatically
3. WHEN server is unreachable THEN the system SHALL provide retry options with exponential backoff
4. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL handle parsing errors gracefully
5. WHEN timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL cancel requests and inform the user appropriately

### Requirement 9
