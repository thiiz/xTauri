- SearchResult structure groups by content type
- Separate arrays for channels, movies, and series

### Requirement 9.3 ✅
"WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL support filtering by category, genre, and rating"
- ChannelFilter, MovieFilter, and SeriesFilter structures
- Support for all specified filter criteria

### Requirement 9.4 ✅
"WHEN search returns no results THEN the system SHALL display appropriate 'no results' messaging"
- Empty result arrays indicate no matches
- Total results count for easy checking

### Requirement 9.5 ✅
"WHEN clearing search THEN the system SHALL return to the previous content view"
- Clear functions for search and filters
- State management support for view restoration

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests
