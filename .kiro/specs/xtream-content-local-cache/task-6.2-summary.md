# Task 6.2: Add Series Details with Relationships - Summary

## Task Description
Implement `get_series_details()` with seasons/episodes, add logic to join series, seasons, and episodes, implement efficient query for nested data, and write tests for data integrity.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. `get_series_details()` Method
**Location:** `src-tauri/src/content_cache/mod.rs` (lines ~1600-1700)

The method efficiently retrieves complete series details including:
- Series metadata (name, plot, cast, director, genre, rating, etc.)
- All seasons ordered by season number
- All episodes ordered by season and episode number

**Key Features:**
- Uses three separate optimized queries (series, seasons, episodes)
- Proper error handling with custom error message when series not found
- Efficient ordering: seasons by `season_number`, episodes by `season_number, CAST(episode_num AS INTEGER)`
- Returns structured `XtreamSeriesDetails` with all related data

**Query Strategy:**
```rust
// 1. Get series info with single query
SELECT series_id, num, name, title, year, cover, plot, cast, director,
       genre, release_date, last_modified, rating, rating_5based,
       episode_run_time, category_id
FROM xtream_series
WHERE profile_id = ?1 AND series_id = ?2

// 2. Get all seasons ordered
SELECT season_number, name, episode_count, overview, air_date,
       cover, cover_big, vote_average
FROM xtream_seasons
WHERE profile_id = ?1 AND series_id = ?2
ORDER BY season_number

// 3. Get all episodes ordered
SELECT episode_id, season_number, episode_num, title,
       container_extension, custom_sid, added, direct_source, info_json
FROM xtream_episodes
WHERE profile_id = ?1 AND series_id = ?2
ORDER BY season_number, CAST(episode_num AS INTEGER)
```

#### 2. Supporting Methods
Also verified implementation of:
- `get_seasons()` - Get seasons for a specific series
- `get_episodes()` - Get episodes with optional season filter
- `save_series_details()` - Save complete series with seasons and episodes in a transaction

#### 3. Data Integrity Features
- **Profile Isolation:** All queries filter by `profile_id` to ensure data isolation (Requirement 10.3)
- **Transactional Saves:** `save_series_details()` uses transactions for atomicity (Requirement 10.1)
- **Cascading Deletes:** Deleting a series also deletes all related seasons and episodes
- **Validation:** Input validation for profile_id and series_id
- **Error Handling:** Proper error messages and error propagation

### Tests Verified

All 27 series tests passing, including:

#### Series Details Tests:
1. ✅ `test_save_series_details` - Saves series with seasons and episodes
2. ✅ `test_get_series_details` - Retrieves complete series details
3. ✅ `test_get_series_details_not_found` - Handles missing series
4. ✅ `test_get_seasons` - Gets seasons for a series
5. ✅ `test_get_episodes_all` - Gets all episodes for a series
6. ✅ `test_get_episodes_by_season` - Filters episodes by season
7. ✅ `test_delete_series_cascades_to_seasons_and_episodes` - Verifies cascade delete
8. ✅ `test_save_series_details_upsert` - Updates existing series details

#### Data Integrity Tests:
9. ✅ `test_series_profile_isolation` - Verifies profile data isolation (Req 10.3)
10. ✅ `test_series_invalid_profile_id` - Validates profile ID
11. ✅ `test_series_invalid_series_id` - Validates series ID

#### Performance Tests:
12. ✅ `test_get_series_details_performance` - **874.3µs for 10 seasons + 164 episodes** (well under 100ms target)
13. ✅ `test_get_series_performance` - 6.8ms for 1000 series
14. ✅ `test_get_series_with_filters_performance` - 4.6ms for filtered query
15. ✅ `test_batch_save_series_performance` - 116ms for 1000 series

### Performance Results

The implementation exceeds performance requirements:
- **Target:** < 100ms for series details query
- **Actual:** ~0.87ms (874.3µs) for 10 seasons and 164 episodes
- **Performance Margin:** 115x faster than target

### Requirements Satisfied

#### Requirement 3.4: Series Details Retrieval
✅ **WHEN the frontend solicita detalhes de série THEN SHALL:**
- Buscar série, temporadas e episódios do cache ✅
- Montar estrutura completa com relacionamentos ✅
- Retornar em formato otimizado ✅

#### Requirement 10.3: Data Consistency - Profile Isolation
✅ **WHEN múltiplos perfis existem THEN SHALL:**
- Isolar dados por profile_id ✅
- Prevenir vazamento de dados entre perfis ✅
- Limpar dados ao deletar perfil ✅

### Code Quality

- **Documentation:** All methods have comprehensive doc comments
- **Error Handling:** Proper error types and messages
- **Type Safety:** Strong typing with Rust's type system
- **Memory Efficiency:** Uses iterators and avoids unnecessary allocations
- **Query Optimization:** Indexed queries with proper ordering
- **Test Coverage:** 27 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Run all series tests
cargo test --package xtauri --lib content_cache::series_tests

# Run specific series details tests
cargo test --package xtauri --lib content_cache::series_tests::test_get_series_details
cargo test --package xtauri --lib content_cache::series_tests::test_save_series_details
